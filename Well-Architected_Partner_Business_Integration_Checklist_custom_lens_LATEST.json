Instead of focussing on specific components, work backwards from customer outcomes you repeatedly enable with larger modules.

For example, a Well-Architected review can be used to create backlog items, and then closing a backlog HRI item updates the Well-Architected review. This bi-directional integration means that Well-Architected reviews can track the risk profile of a workload in near real-time as development proceeds. Consider how milestones can be created automatically from project phases or sprints to provide a measure of best practice alignment as the project progresses. Bi-directional integration helps keep reviews up to date and removes the necessity of manual update processes.

By leveraging integrated ISV tools, your consultants can save both their and your customer's time when running a review. They can spend more time diving deep on specific domains of concern to build a more accurate picture of a customer's workload than would be possible without tooling. Long-term integration with ISV tooling should be considered where there is the requirement to continuously monitor workloads for best-practice alignment. On workloads undergoing rapid development or evolution, the right solution in conjunction with appropriate guard-rails may help a workload maintain alignment through automated remediation.

This increases both the cost and risk to your business associated with the workload. When taking operational responsibility for a customer workload it's essential to understand the latent risks associated with the environment. All workloads under management require a Well-Architected review to surface latent risk and inform the operational backlog. Start by building a list of customer workloads, and prioritize by multiple dimensions. Consider customer industry and risk exposure, account complexity, and operational effort required to support the customer to date. Reducing the time and effort required to support a specific customer by remediating high-risk issues (HRIs) means you can more provide better coverage to your remaining customers. You can uncover new sources of value and opportunities to reduce risk for both you and your customers."
